[00:31.23] I feel soon
[00:37.26] I will sink
[00:43.66] Into you
[00:49.61] What do you think?
[00:58.61] 
[00:54.79] 'Cause there's still blood
[01:02.13] In your hair
[01:07.82] I've got the bruise
[01:14.27] Of the year
[01:19.77] 
[01:18.22] But there's something about her
[01:22.44] Long, shady eyes
[01:30.14] I'm all about her shade tonight
[01:45.64] 
[01:45.83] I hate your tattoos
[01:57.99] You have weak wrists
[02:04.39] But I'll keep you
[02:12.89] 
[02:07.69] 'Cause there's something about her
[02:12.46] Long, shady eyes
[02:19.76] I'm all about her shade tonight
[02:35.26] 
[02:32.73] Well, it's too bad
[02:39.44] It's too bad
[02:45.94] It's too bad
[02:50.12] You're married to me
