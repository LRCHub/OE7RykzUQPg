[00:20.75] A wraith with an angel's body
[00:23.46] A demon with a smile of gold
[00:25.92] You soul-sucker, I won't become like you
[00:31.09] A killer with the perfect weapons
[00:33.53] Crystal eyes and a heart of coal

[01:52.31] Look how pretty she is when she falls down
[01:57.89] Now there's no beauty in bleeding mascara
[02:03.21] Her lips are quivering like a withering rose
[02:08.23] She's back again, she's back a...
[02:12.87] She's back again, she's back
